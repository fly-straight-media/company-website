            Third-parties outside of Fly Straight Media who provide services to us (e.g. analytics and crash reporting), including our ad partners. Although we have carefully reviewed who we decide to partner with, we do not have direct control over how our Service Providers use your information. For this reason, we are not responsible for our Service Providers’ misuse of your information and suggest that you consult their own privacy policies to learn about what data they collect and how do they use it.
